# Update channel - axiom-cli

This guide is owned and released with `axiom-cli` under task **J-007**
(`axiom-cli-distribution`, requirements R16, R22, R06). It describes the update path that
`axiom-cli` actually implements today, and it distinguishes what has been executed on a real
host from what has not. The canonical rules stay in `axiom-specs`:
`docs/20-VERSION-CHECK-UPDATE-RELEASE.md`, `contracts/axiom-cli-distribution-contract.md` and
`contracts/schemas/update-plan.schema.json` with `tools/update_plan_contract.py`. Do not fork them
here.

## Path decision (recorded)

The task card proposed `src/update/` and `channels/stable.json`; both were created exactly there.
No path was widened or renamed, and nothing was added outside `axiom-cli`.

```text
src/update/mod.rs        the `update` verb surface and the subcommand vocabulary
src/update/apply.rs      check / plan / apply / rollback and the whole transaction
src/update/channel.rs    the channel manifest: parse, validate, digest, reject placeholders
src/update/plan.rs       plan construction, canonical digest and the mirrored contract checks
src/update/generation.rs one immutable generation: its record and its payload
src/update/journal.rs    the transaction journal and crash recovery
src/update/fetch.rs      artifact acquisition from the local, isolated cache
src/update/sha256.rs     the in-repo SHA-256 used for every digest
src/update/health.rs     the post-swap health probe
src/update/state.rs      the install root, its record and its lock
src/update/rules.rs      shared rules: digests, SemVer, relative paths, forbidden pins
src/update/json.rs       the single-JSON-object envelope writer and a canonical JSON writer
src/update/report.rs     report and exit-code vocabulary
src/update/error.rs      the refusal classes that map to the canonical exit codes
src/update/time.rs       UTC timestamps
channels/stable.json     the channel manifest this repository publishes
tests/update_channel.rs  the acceptance and boundary suite (23 legs)
```

## The four verbs

```text
axiom-cli update check   [--json] [--all]
axiom-cli update plan    --to <semver> [--out <file>] [--json]
axiom-cli update apply   --plan <file> --approve-digest <sha256> [--json]
axiom-cli update rollback --transaction previous|<id> [--json]
```

`check` and `plan` are read-only. `apply` is the only mutating verb. `rollback` moves the active
pointer and never downloads.

Exit codes follow the frozen vocabulary of `docs/40-CLI-ARGV-SURFACE.md`: `0` success, `2`
validation refusal, `3` not found, `4` not ready, `6` conflict, `8` I/O or internal, `9`
incompatible, `10` lock unavailable. `--json` writes exactly one JSON object on stdout and keeps
diagnostics on stderr; the short machine token is `details.reason_code` and the full stated reason
is `details.reason`.

## Where versions come from

On the update path, versions are resolved **only** from the channel manifest that the installed
release recorded. (Installation and `version` can additionally read a manifest named by `--from` or
`AXIOM_CLI_CHANNEL_MANIFEST`; see `docs/40-CLI-ARGV-SURFACE.md`.) The update path never resolves a
branch tip, a tag alias, a network `latest`, or an unsigned channel:

- a version equal to `main`, `master`, `develop`, `latest`, `HEAD` or `*` is refused with
  `forbidden_pin:<value>`;
- a manifest without a `trust_root`, or without a `signature_artifact`, is refused with
  `unsigned_channel`;
- a manifest whose `metadata_expiry` has passed is refused with `channel_metadata_expired` as
  incompatible (`9`), and the same check runs again at `apply` time so a window that closes
  between approval and application cannot be exploited;
- the recorded manifest bytes are re-hashed and compared with `installed.json`; a mismatch is
  `recorded_manifest_digest_mismatch`.

## Verification, swap and rollback

For every artifact the plan names, the cache copy is re-hashed and its length is compared with the
manifest **before** the bytes are used. A mismatch is `artifact_digest_mismatch` and nothing is
swapped. An artifact that cannot be obtained stays unverified and the verb answers not-ready (`4`,
`artifact_unreachable`) rather than reporting an applied update.

The swap keeps the previous generation until the new one is verified:

```text
recover an interrupted transaction
-> take the coordinator lock
-> read the recorded channel manifest of the installed release
-> refuse unless the plan agrees with it, component by component
-> stage, then verify length and sha256 of every artifact before it is used
-> write the journal, then rename the staging tree into generations/<id>
-> swap installed.json atomically, keeping the previous generation
-> health check the new generation
-> on failure: restore the previous generation and report a rollback
-> on success: finalise the journal, prune older generations, release the lock
```

A generation that fails its own health probe is **not** promoted to the retained rollback target,
because the retained target must be a generation that was verified. `rollback --transaction
previous` therefore answers `no_previous_generation` (`6`) instead of re-activating bytes that just
failed. Every changed component is reported per component under `needs_restart`.
## Install root layout

The update layer owns one install root and nothing else. It never writes into the workspace, the
graph output root or portable state:

```text
<install-root>/
  installed.json              the release record: schema_version, channel,
                              channel_manifest_sha256, current_generation,
                              previous_generation, installed_at
  recorded-manifest.json      the exact channel manifest bytes the installed release recorded;
                              re-hashed and compared with installed.json on every verb
  update.lock                 the coordinator lock; a stale lock refuses with
                              lock_unavailable (10) instead of proceeding
  generations/<id>/           one immutable generation: generation.json + payload/**
  staging/<transaction>/      the transaction's staging tree, renamed into place on commit
  journal/<transaction>.json  the transaction journal; the next run recovers it
```

Generation ids look like `g-<utc-stamp>-<hex>` and transaction ids like `t-<utc-stamp>-<hex>`;
both are lowercase. A generation is only ever added whole. The active pointer in `installed.json`
is the single mutable value the swap replaces, and `previous_generation` is what rollback returns
to.

## The trust root is a development seed

`channels/stable.json` publishes no release and offers no artifact: `published` is `false` and
every component's `artifacts` is empty, because publication is closed for this wave. Nothing is
invented: a component whose owning repository does not declare a SemVer version is recorded as
`undeclared` with `version` and `revision` `null` (today `axiom-mcp`, whose `pyproject.toml`
declares the PEP 440 `0.0.0.dev0`, which is not SemVer).

`trust.trust_root` is the SHA-256 of this ASCII preimage, written here so it can be re-derived:

```text
axiom-cli dev channel trust root v1 (development seed; not a release signing root)
sha256 = 23e4845c8e76c7cf8642b2c47f759d401345424309aec6b3bf4ad8413b40ee7a
```

It is **not** a release signing root, and `trust.signature_artifact` is `null`, so the manifest is
an unsigned channel: `update plan` refuses it with `unsigned_channel` (2). Replacing the seed with
a real signed manifest, `published: true` and real artifact entries is a later, publication-open
task.
## Versions, digests and the local-only artifact cache

Three environment overrides exist so a fixture can be driven end to end without touching a real
install root. They are not update-only: `AXIOM_CLI_INSTALL_ROOT` and `AXIOM_CLI_CHANNEL_MANIFEST`
also govern `install`, `uninstall`, `doctor` and `version`, and `AXIOM_CLI_ARTIFACT_CACHE` is the
cache `install` verifies against. They are the documented way to run the distribution path by hand
(the full override table is in `docs/40-CLI-ARGV-SURFACE.md`):

```text
AXIOM_CLI_INSTALL_ROOT       the install root; otherwise the per-user data location
                             (Windows %LOCALAPPDATA%\Axiom, else $XDG_DATA_HOME/axiom,
                             else $HOME/.local/share/axiom)
AXIOM_CLI_CHANNEL_MANIFEST   a channel manifest to read while nothing is installed yet
AXIOM_CLI_ARTIFACT_CACHE     the local artifact cache used for offline acquisition
```

Acquisition is deliberately local-only, which is what makes the offline case testable honestly.
This layer never contacts a remote, opens a socket or follows a redirect:

- an artifact URL is keyed by its last path segment and resolved under
  `AXIOM_CLI_ARTIFACT_CACHE`, or from a `file://` location;
- an `https://` artifact that is not present in the cache answers `artifact_unreachable` (4);
- a copy whose length or sha256 differs from the manifest is `artifact_digest_mismatch` (2), and
  the bad copy is deleted rather than left where a later step could mistake it for a verified one;
- the active version is read only from the channel manifest the installed release recorded, so a
  branch tip, a tag alias and a network `latest` are structurally unreachable.

## Windows atomicity limits (stated, not assumed)

The swap is an atomic pointer change plus a directory rename inside one install root. That has two
honest limits on Windows:

- a rename cannot replace an executable that is currently running. The active pointer is still
  swapped atomically; taking effect needs the affected process to restart, which is why every
  changed component is reported under `needs_restart` rather than being reported live;
- this layer moves the pointer and the generations. The engine that owns a component's canonical
  executable path and its restart stays in `axiom-graphd` (I-003/I-004) and is not exercised here.

The path needs no administrator rights, no symlink privilege, no Bash and no WSL: it is a per-user
directory the user can write. Locking is a single file (`update.lock`), and the journal is what
makes an interrupted apply recoverable instead of half-applied.
## What is verified, and what is not

Verified on this host: the whole `update check|plan|apply|rollback` machinery, against local
on-disk fixtures, on **windows-x64**, using the real release binary. Positive, negative and
boundary legs are recorded with their exit codes under `evidence/J-007/`.

This is the `J-007` recorded capture (`windows-x64`). The current development host is `macos-x64`;
no native run of the lifecycle verbs added later is recorded there, and no target is `certified`.

Explicitly **unverified**:

- `linux-x64`, `macos-arm64` and `macos-x64`: no native run exists. A WSL2 run is Linux evidence
  and is never Windows evidence, and no platform is certified by this document;
- real channel resolution: the trust root above is a development seed and the manifest is
  unsigned, so resolving against a published, signed channel stays unverified by construction.

## Reproducing the evidence

```text
cargo build --release --locked
cargo test --locked --all-targets            # 89 unit + 14 argv_surface + 56 cli_verbs + 9 container_distribution + 6 linux_distribution + 24 update_channel
```

The acceptance transcript was produced by a scratch harness under `_w10ev/`, which is never
committed and rebuilds and deletes its own fixtures under `_w10ev/fx/` on each run:

```text
pwsh -NoProfile -File '_w10ev/run-ac2.ps1'   # requires target\release\axiom-cli.exe
```

Deleting that directory does not affect the committed evidence, which is the verbatim captured
output under `evidence/J-007/`.
