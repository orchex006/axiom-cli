# axiom-cli documentation

**Installing Axiom?** Start with [INSTALL](INSTALL.md). It covers the one-line install, update, uninstall, upgrading from 0.1.0/0.1.2 and troubleshooting.

These guides are owned and released with `axiom-cli`. They describe what this repository implements today.

| Guide | For | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) | Users | Install, check, update, uninstall, upgrade, troubleshooting |
| [30-DISTRIBUTION-AND-INSTALLERS](30-DISTRIBUTION-AND-INSTALLERS.md) | Maintainers | How install, PATH, bootstrappers and legacy adoption work; test harnesses; the historical J-004 Windows runbook |
| [40-CLI-ARGV-SURFACE](40-CLI-ARGV-SURFACE.md) | Maintainers | Every verb, option, exit code and environment override |
| [50-UPDATE-CHANNEL](50-UPDATE-CHANNEL.md) | Maintainers | The update channel and transaction |
| [50-CONTAINER-CHANNEL](50-CONTAINER-CHANNEL.md) | Maintainers | The container and air-gapped channel (separate publication status) |
| [60-LINUX-AND-MACOS-ARM64](60-LINUX-AND-MACOS-ARM64.md) | Maintainers | Linux and macOS arm64 delivery |

The distribution contract and the platform matrix are canonical in `axiom-specs`; resolve cross-component normative references through the pinned `axiom-specs` revision. Do not create a local editable copy of them. A published site can aggregate documentation from immutable revisions without an extra repository.
