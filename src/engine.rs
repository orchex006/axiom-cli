//! Discovery of, and delegation to, the `axiom-graphd` installation engine.
//!
//! The distribution contract puts the installation engine, the bootstrap rules, the service
//! lifecycle and the per-component update transaction in `axiom-graphd`. `axiom-cli` is a
//! distribution layer: where a behaviour already exists in the engine, this CLI invokes it
//! through the engine's documented argv surface and reports its result. It never forks the
//! engine and never re-implements it.
//!
//! Two rules shape this module:
//!
//! * Invocation is program plus argv. Nothing here builds a shell string, so an argument can
//!   never be re-parsed as a command.
//! * A missing engine is a *not found* condition with the exact places that were searched, not a
//!   silent success and not a blanket "not ready". The operator is told which binary to place.
